# Coursera - Optimize TensorFlow Models For Deployment with TensorRT

- Welcome to Optimize TensorFlow Models For Deployment with TensorRT. This is a project-based course which should take approximately 1.5 hours to complete. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

### Course Objectives
- In this course, we are going to focus on three learning objectives:
    - Optimize Tensorflow models using TensorRT (TF-TRT)  
    - Use TF-TRT to optimize several deep learning models at FP32, FP16, and INT8 precision
    - Observe how tuning TF-TRT parameters affects performance and inference throughput  

- This is a hands-on, guided project on optimizing your TensorFlow models for inference with NVIDIA's TensorRT. By the end of this 1.5 hour long project, you will be able to optimize Tensorflow models using the TensorFlow integration of NVIDIA's TensorRT (TF-TRT), use TF-TRT to optimize several deep learning models at FP32, FP16, and INT8 precision, and observe how tuning TF-TRT parameters affects performance and inference throughput.   
- **Prerequisites**: In order to successfully complete this project, you should be competent in Python programming, understand deep learning and what inference is, and have experience building deep learning models in TensorFlow and its Keras API.

- **Note**: This course works best for learners who are based in the North America region. Weâ€™re currently working on providing the same experience in other regions.

### Project Structure
- The hands on project on Optimize TensorFlow Models For Deployment with TensorRT is divided into following tasks:

    - **Task 1**:  Introduction and Project Overview
    - **Task 2**: Setup your TensorFlow and TensorRT Runtime
    - **Task 3**: Load the Data and Pre-trained InceptionV3 Model 
    - **Task 4**: Create batched Input
    - **Task 5**: Load the TensorFlow SavedModel
    - **Task 6**: Get Baseline for Prediction Throughput and Accuracy
    - **Task 7**: Convert a TensorFlow saved model into a TF-TRT Float32 Graph
    - **Task 8**: Benchmark TF-TRT Float32
    - **Task 9**: Convert to TF-TRT Float16 and Benchmark
    - **Task 10**: TF-TRT INT8 Models
    - **Task 11**: Converting to TF-TRT INT8
